knockblock
==========

A library for writing strong, eventually consistent programs in Python


Goal
----

The aim is to make it easy for Python developers to write distributed
programs that are strongly and eventually consistent.

We do that by providing:

- A library of basic convergent data types and containers
- An interface for defining your own data types and containers
- A rich set of tools for creating distributed knockblock programs
- An API for network backends to run knockblock programs
